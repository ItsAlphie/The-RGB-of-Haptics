# The RGB of Haptics: The Impact of Haptic Primary Colours on Texture Perception for Extended Reality
## What's this project about?
This repository contains the code and framework developed for our Master's thesis project at KU Leuven.
The project explores haptic feedback in Extended Reality (XR) through the design and evaluation of a wearable glove prototype. The glove implements the Haptic Primary Color Theory (HPCT), a conceptual model that breaks down tactile sensations into basic "haptic primitives" such as hardness, roughness, and thermal feedback.

By combining these primitives, the glove aims to approximate textures and materials in a way that enhances immersion in XR environments.

## Project Overview

### Hardware: 
A custom-built haptic glove integrating miniaturized actuators (vibro-tactile, thermal, and pressure feedback).

### Software: 
A Unity-based VR environment for rendering virtual textures and controlling haptic output. (Unity version 2022.3.58f1)

### Framework: 
Wireless communication between the glove's microcontroller and Unity to synchronize haptic feedback with virtual interactions.

### Evaluation:
* User Test 1: Psychophysical identification of base haptic primitives without visual stimuli.
* User Test 2: Material comparison test with real-world analogues to evaluate texture approximation.
